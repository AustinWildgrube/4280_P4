Here we are translating our FS language to ASM which we can run at:
https://comp.umsl.edu/assembler/interpreter

To make the project just simply type "make" in the directory.
To clean this project just simply type "make clean" in the directory.

Usage: compfs
Usage: compfs [fileName].fs
Usage: compfs < fileName.fs

For example: ./compfs [fileName].fs

This program ONLY accepts .fs files.

An example file is included and can be ran using the command:
./compfs test/test_data.fs
